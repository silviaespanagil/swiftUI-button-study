# SwiftUI: Button styling
## _a little study_

¡Hola mundo!

Another day another SwiftUI Repo. This repo is about buttons. When I started doing Swift and wrote my first button down I was underwhelmed about how they were because well...they're ugly 😔. So I started reading a seing how to customize buttons and I found A LOT of ways. 

So, this is a little study 📖 of different ways to customize buttons. You can read my [Dev.to post about it here](https://dev.to/silviaespanagil/swiftui-tips-for-styling-buttons-1n4d) 


## Want to clone this repo? 🐑

I've done this repo in order to share different ways of styling buttons using SwiftUI. Feel free to download, clone or fork this repo, I really hope you find it usefull.
